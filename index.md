## Why hello there!

You've stumbled upon one of my many corners of the internet.

This page was created to test the functionality of GitHub Pages and hopefully use it as a viable blog platform. There's going to be fun stuff like testing out Jekyll (a static page generator), editing DNS records, interesting tech-related news I crawl across and feedback from meetups I attend.

While I'm writing this out in a lovely Markdown window right now, the goal is for the sophistication of the blog to grow as I learn more.

Stay tuned and stay in touch! (There are links in the top-right to follow me online.)

  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
